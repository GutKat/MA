# STEM = all base pairs in the stem
# INTERIOR LOOP = all nt that are not base paired within the stem
# HAIRPIN LOOP = all nt that are not base paired, excluding the closing base pair
# BULGE LEFT / RIGHT = all nt that are unpaired, left meaning near 5' (begin), right meaning near 3' (end)
# MULTI LOOP = all nt that are unpaired, including nt of pseudoknots, excluding closing base pairs, between Stem I and Stem II, between Stem II and Stem III, between Stem III and Stem I
# NT until PK1 = all nt which are in no structure until the first pseudoknot
# NT between PK1 and PK2 = all nt between the first and second pseudoknot
# number of Sequence = number of sequences used for MSA
# NEGV xrRNA2 truncated at 3'
# 
# xrRNA-no: xrRNA 1 or 2
# Stems: ST-I, ST-II, ST-III; interior loop: IL; bulge left/right: BL/R; hairpin loop: HL-I, HL-II, HL-III; multi-loop: ML-I/II, ML-II/III, ML-III/I
# until PK1: uPK1, between PK1 and PK2, PK1bPK2, Pseudoknots present: PKS?; number of sequences: numSeqs
