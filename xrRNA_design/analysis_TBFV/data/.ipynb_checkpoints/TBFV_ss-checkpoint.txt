# STEM = all base pairs in the stem
# INTERIOR LOOP = all nt that are not base paired within the stem
# HAIRPIN LOOP = all nt that are not base paired, excluding the closing base pair
# BULGE LEFT / RIGHT = all nt that are unpaired, left meaning near 5' (begin), right meaning near 3' (end)
# MULTI LOOP = all nt that are unpaired, including nt of pseudoknots, excluding closing base pairs, between Stem I and Stem II, between Stem II and Stem III, between Stem III and Stem I
# NT until PK1 = all nt which are in no structure until the first pseudoknot
# NT between PK1 and PK2 = all nt between the first and second pseudoknot
# number of Sequence = number of sequences used for MSA
# NEGV xrRNA2 truncated at 3'
# 
# xrRNA-no: xrRNA 1 or 2
